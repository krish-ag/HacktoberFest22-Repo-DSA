'''
Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, 
return true if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

Note: that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

Examples

1. Input:- s= 'deepImpact' , wordDict = ['deep','Im','pact']
   Output:- True (Because deepImpact can be segregated into words mentioned in wordDict )
2. Input:- s= 'mangoinmango' , wordDict = ['mango','in','mango']
   Output:- True (Same word occurring twice )
3. Input:- s= 'deepfacts' , wordDict = ['deep','pact']
   Output:- False (Because pacts is not mentioned in wordDict )
